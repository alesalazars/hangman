## Hangman

This game is pretty well known but instructions are as follow:

1. A random word appears at the top.
2. Enter a letter in the input and then either click the "**Enter**" key on your keyboard or click the **button** next to the input.
3. If the letter is right it will appear in the spaces above, if not, it will go into the Wrong Letter Box so the player knows which letters not to input again.
4. The player has 5 lives to use, if the game is lost then the button below has to be clicked to restart the game.
